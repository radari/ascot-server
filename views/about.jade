  h2 About Ascot
  p 
    | We got tired of looking at beautiful pictures of awesome outfits all over the internet and having no clue where to get the clothes. 
    | We love fashion sites and use them for inspiration but we thought the online fashion community could do a better job of keeping track of products in pictures. 
    | Ascot makes it easy to tag products in pictures and keep the information as th picture gets shared. Here is an example
  br
  iframe(src='/look/50beef4cd2e16da231000008/iframe', width='604', height='836', frameborder= '0')
  br
  p
    | Picture this: you write a fashion blog, and are just about to post a picture of yourself wearing a really
    | fly outfit.  You want to give your readers information on the clothes you're wearing so that they can appreciate
    | how stylish you must be to put together an ensemble like thatâ€¦ and maybe but those clothes themselves. Instead 
    | of going through and typing out all of this information by hand, you can just use Ascot to quickly and easily
    | tag the clothes directly onto the picture. 
  br
  p 
    | Even cooler, if one of your readers shares the picture on social networks, forums, or other blogs, the
    | Ascot layer will come with it. That means that all of the people who find it will be able to see
    | exactly the same useful information on the clothes.  And the best part?  Ascot shows everyone that the
    | image came from your blog, so anyone who sees the picture (anywhere on the internet) will know that it came
    | from you. And that you're awesome. And that they should go to your blog.

    | So what are you waiting for?
